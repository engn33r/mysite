As technology marches onwards, we’re able to perform an ever increasing number of tasks from the comfort of our connected devices. A variety of apps are replacing everyday tasks with a more modern approach. Calling for pizza delivery, waiting until you arrive at a restaurant to order your food, and an increasing number of tasks can now have minutes or seconds shaved off when the corresponding app is used.

But the usage of these newly abundant services adds an additional degree of complexity to the systems they interact with. Rarely do additional features come without additional overhead. The question then is whether the pros (convenience for the user) can outweigh the cons (overhead to the provider) of this service. While the choice may rest on the quantity of users, there’s also the question of how marginal an improvement in convenience is worthwhile for before creating a service.

If we go back in time, it would seem that the cost of integrating indoor plumbing into houses was an obvious win. The possibility of bacteria entering groundwater was reduced, and the users found this change convenient enough to pay for. Fast forward and we may decide that Wikipedia is far superior to a paper encyclopedia in depth and breadth. Likewise, the ability to have an internet connection through your cell phone data plan, rather than seeking out wifi, has been shown to be a feature that users will eagerly pay for. But is there a limit to how easy and convenient all resources and tasks will become in the future?

There’s now services that can pick up your clothes and return them after washing them. You can get someone to walk your dog or do some housework using your smartphone and an internet connection. Groceries can be selected and ordered online, or if you’re not in the mood to make decisions, you can have all the ingredients for a meal delivered by mail for you to cook. Ordering a movie instead of getting instant access, or waiting more than 2 days for shipping, can feel outdated once a habit is formed.

I only wish to remark on the trend of what technology is bringing forth over time. I don’t think many will complain about exerting less effort to accomplish the same end goal, but I think it is important to understand how we take such conveniences for granted without considering alternatives. Many recent services don’t actually provide an improvement over the default. For instance, smartphone data might be necessary nowadays, but free wifi hotspots can provide the same effect when available. Libraries can offer media at a slower rate than the web, but for those in the US, it’s a service you’re paying for whether you use it or not. But I also have my limits, and would find it hard to ignore Wikipedia and revert to a paper encyclopedia.

In short, the continuous march of technology brings forth increasingly convenient technologies, but don’t forget the alternative options that are also available.

**Weekly Extreme Exception**

I’m partial to unique forms of personal transport. The problem I have with segways is that they have a significantly wider footprint than a person walking (oh, and that pricetag&#8230;), and electric skateboards don’t have the wheels or suspension for off-road usage. An electric mountainboard can get around some of these difficulties, but then I found a new personal favorite: electric unicycles. This guy might be the most extreme user, but it looks like good fun.
