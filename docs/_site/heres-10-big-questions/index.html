          <p>Sometime last year, I realized that there’s many big questions that have passed through my mind that I couldn’t say I had a good answer to. For instance, I used to be asked (in my younger days) “What do you want to be when you grow up?”, but a more relevant question for me now is “what job/role are you going to have in 10 years?”.</p>

<p>I believe that answering these long-term questions are important to setting a trajectory and serving as a reminder to stay on track. I recently compiled a list of questions that I thought could better orient my daily choices. Many of these come from various interviews I’ve heard, so I decided to “interview myself” and dedicate some time to think about some serious answers to these questions. See if you’ve got your answers ready for the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you could go back in time and give one piece of advice to your 20-year old self, what would it be?</li>
  <li>Who is the first person that comes to mind when you hear the word “success”?</li>
  <li>What are your lifetime goals?</li>
  <li>How would you like to spend the next 5 years?</li>
  <li>What’s your greatest fear?</li>
  <li>If you had all the world’s resources but could only solve one problem, what problem would you solve?</li>
  <li>If you could be remembered for only one thing, what would it be?</li>
  <li>What important truth do very few people agree with you on?</li>
  <li>Imagine you suddenly received everything you wanted. Describe what your perfect day would look like in as much detail as possible, from waking up to bedtime.</li>
  <li>What goal are you working on achieving right now?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Weekly Extreme Exception</strong></p>

<p>I must have been less than 10 years old when I caught the flying bug. A local air show got me hooked as the aerobatic planes performed maneuvers than seemed physically impossible in the air. I am happy to say I now have the means to pursue the dream of a pilot’s license, and although it’s not quite as easy as turning the key and taking off, it’s a lot of fun. It was only by making a conscious choice to set priorities that has allowed me to do that.</p>

<p>However, the two guys in the video have been flying together for longer than I’ve been wishing I could fly. If you’re familiar with the Red Bull Air Race, another event that I’m a fan of, one of these pilots (Steve) is a judge and the other (Paul) is a three time winner of the event. Although the video is cut to make the stunt appear “dramatic”, I doubt these two would have gone through with it if there were any serious concerns.</p>
