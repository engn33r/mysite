I dislike changing long-term goals that I think have much to offer, but I had to weigh my prior judgment against the new data that became available after several months of writing. I hope that less frequent posts will improve the overall writing  quality. Here’s a list of things I’ve learned and why I have decided to make this shift:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/04/drawingboard-300x172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of X&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing is time consuming and harder than it looks. I have new respect for authors of all types!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concise wording is a learned skill. One of my goals is to improve on this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer writing about certain topics more than others. I really had to try different topics to figure this out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making an outline is valuable and makes the writing process much easier. Starting to write without a plan can be problematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the recent explosion of competitions incentivizing technology development exciting for its simple but ambitious goal. Unlike subjective awards, a competition requires a concise means of determining a winner, and when the pool of potential participants is virtually unbounded, it can allow for breakthroughs from unexpected places. The XPRIZE is the example that is foremost in my mind, primarily due to its longevity and the caliber of participating groups. Hats off to Peter Diamandis for creating the initiative (among his other intriguing work). The XPRIZE website lists the active and past prizes, but the Google Lunar XPRIZE is a recent one that garnered a fair bit of attention. This video shows the winning team from the Ansari XPRIZE, which was the first XPRIZE competition. In October 2004, the Scaled Composites team managed to achieve the goal of launching a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. Impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

Crime, scandals, poverty… it just doesn’t end! But is this an accurate picture on a multi-decade timeline? Arguably not, and I find it helpful to reflect on positive big picture trends. Although hedonic adaptation may enable us to constantly adjust to the new normal, there’s good reason to think that humanity’s trajectory can look positive from at least some perspectives. Here’s a few trends that could be considered positive indicators of our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/04/Oz_utopia-768x563.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Utopia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewable energy sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept behind renewable energy is that it can be replenished within a reasonable timespan. At the end of the day, the amount of easily accessible oil on the planet is limited, and in the long run we will probably need something else. Putting aside arguments over whether the current acceleration towards renewable energy is sufficient to allow for greenhouse gas reduction, the global trend is certainly in the right direction. Iceland already generates about 100% of their electricity needs using renewable sources (thanks largely to the geothermal activity on their island), while Sweden is over the 50% threshold and Germany is around the 20% mark. With current trajectories, there should be significant improvement in these numbers over the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a utopia mindset, medicine can be considered the eradication of diseases and sickness. By many measures we’re arguably early in this journey, but the global eradication of smallpox has shown this is possible. Polio is likely to be the next disease to be globally eradicated, and substantial effort is being put into eradicating malaria. Outside of these infectious diseases, there’s reasons to hope that knowledge around what constitutes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/maslow-pt4/&quot;&gt;a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; (by today’s standards of “healthy”) is becoming more widespread, such as sugary drink taxes in multiple countries. Although the number of diet-related health risks is very high worldwide, the continued developments in the medical field appear to be able to support increasing longevity for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s harder to answer the question of what a utopian global economics situation looks like. Would the world be a better place if everyone was suddenly a millionaire, or would there be significant downsides to such a situation? If the entire world’s population was shopping and consuming at the level of many developed nations, there may be substantial environmental impact. Without dwelling too much on the philosophical nature of utopian economics, I think one scenario of an ideal state of global economics is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy&quot;&gt;post-scarcity economy&lt;/a&gt;. Based on my minimal knowledge of personal finance, it appears there’s growing interest in the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/&quot;&gt;financial independence&lt;/a&gt;, which could be considered an early indicator of an increasing percentage of the population moving towards this end goal. However, since the global wealth distribution clearly has a long way to go, it’s a question of whether this issue is improving at a reasonably pace for everyone, or only for certain people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are only a few areas to ponder the future of, but absent are, among others: the massive increase in technology over the last several decades, the decrease of violence (see Bill Gates’ recommendation for “The Better Angels of Our Nature” by Pinker), and the decreasing costs of food and energy. As a last tip, if longer term thinking is of interest to you, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/&quot;&gt;Long Now Foundation&lt;/a&gt; may be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One future technology that’s been discussed for decades is the notion of a self-driving car. While there’s a lot of companies working on the real deal at the current time, it’s fun to take a look at the state-of-the-art technology back in 2005! This DARPA Grand Challenge required an autonomous vehicle to drive over 100 miles through the desert. It’s interesting how that task is easier today, but isn’t yet considered something that a small team of undergraduate students can put together for a class project. It makes me ponder if we are as close to fully autonomous vehicles as many companies think we are.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably a lot. There’s a reason that Google built an entire computer operating system around browser usage. Odds are you’d have a lot less to do if your web browser was taken away from you. It’s because web browsing has become such a centerpiece of everyday life that I think it’s worthwhile to spend some time upgrading your security and privacy in your browser.&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_136&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-136&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/04/cat-tinfoilhat-300x217.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;This cat does it right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing, I’d like to add that the security chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link, and that link is often the human in the loop. Sorry to insinuate, but you’ve probably reused a password on more than one site in your past, or clicked on a link in an email that might not have been authenticate, or visited sites that you realized may have had nefarious purposes. If you find patches for these human flaws, do let me know, but the tips below can start upgrading your daily security utilization starting now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;1. Update your web browser to the latest version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, as easy as it sounds. As an added bonus, programs most often used for opening files downloaded from the internet (e.g. PDF reader, word processor, image viewer, etc.) should also be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, and while you’re at it, just update your operating system, and all other programs you’ve installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2. Get antivirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antivirus is your friend! Especially for Windows, Mac, Android, etc. And there are multiple free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avast.com/en-us/index&quot;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;. Any questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Use an operating system no one has ever heard of. Or never use the internet. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;3. Modify your browser’s built-in settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you changed your Facebook privacy settings recently, but Read through settings and activate as much security as you please (cookies, plugins, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Firefox users can play around with about:config for more advanced settings, and while chrome users should just switch to Firefox, there’s some additional settings in chrome://flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;4. Use strong and unique passwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t use a password manager yet, I highly recommend it. Using a strong password is a crucial first step towards securing your personal data. Even better, use 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) on important websites, like your financial accounts. Remember not to use the same password on multiple sites – I warned you! You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; to run a (non-comprehensive) check if you were affected by a recent hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Use an offline password manager, because that’s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier does&lt;/a&gt; when designing a password manager. Always max out the allowable password length on websites. Activate 2FA whenever possible. Encrypt everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;5. Use HTTPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activate HTTPS whenever possible. It’s easiest to do with an add-on, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&quot;&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. While you’re at it, you can investigate other add-ons, like ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Install a boatload of addons! One to &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.net/&quot;&gt;block javascript&lt;/a&gt;, one to &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/&quot;&gt;autodelete cookies&lt;/a&gt;, one to &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/&quot;&gt;block WebRTC&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;6. Use WPA2 WiFi encryption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends don’t let friends use anything less than WPA2 security on their WiFi. And remember to use a strong password both for the WiFi hotspot as well as the router login page (usually located at 192.168.0.1 by default). Go ahead, check right now and see if they WiFi you are using is WPA2 or not. If not, run!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/strong&gt; Setup your home network such that only devices you add to your router’s whitelist are allowed on the network. Upgrade to a router that takes security seriously. Always use a VPN or Tor. Maybe add an IDS system to your home network, and a honeypot, just to feel a bit safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re running away from insecure technologies, there’s few better ways to do that than by running over 100 miles. If I had to pick a group of athletes that I’d consider among the most extreme athletes (in terms of mental and physical performance, not risk), ultramarathoners would be among my top picks. I find it intriguing that diet was not much of a concern for ultrarunners 30-40 years ago (the thought being that all calories are good, because they’ll be burnt), but there’s an increasing population of vegans now. Perhaps this is due to increased interest in eating a vegan diet in recent years, but perhaps it’s indicative of some correlation between diet and performance. Scott Jurek is a vegan and one of the most well-known ultramarathoners, having won the Western States 100 mile race seven consecutive times. Admittedly watching someone run isn’t the most exciting action caught on video, but Scott ran the Appalachian Trail in under 47 days (averaging nearly 50 miles/day over rough terrain) to set a new trail record.&lt;/p&gt;

I might write emails regularly, but writing about topics of my choosing isn’t a task I find myself undertaking regularly – hence the creation of this blog. I’ve learned a number of lessons already and will share them to reflect on later and for others to contemplate if undertaking a similar writing experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice makes perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few articles took surprisingly long for me to write, but it’s getting faster, easier, and more entertaining with each week. Not a surprising finding, since I’ve heard of this phenomena on other blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness is the enemy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that many articles so far have been written at the last minute, since I don’t currently keep a backlog of posts. I read the warnings from others that posts should be written well in advance of posting, but I decided that I wanted to write on a regular cadence, making a backlog unnecessary. Yet, given that not every week’s schedule is created equal, I plan to build up a backlog of 3-5 posts to give myself some breathing room if a stretch of a few weeks happens to get busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly posts still take substantial time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought posting monthly was too infrequent, but weekly posts still take over an hour per week at my current writing rate. Hopefully this will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding preferred writing topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been indecisive about what direction I want to take the blog, so it’s currently in an experimental phase without specifics focal topics. Instead, I’ve decided to write about a variety of topics that interest me to see which ones I most enjoy writing about. In the meantime, I hope the range of topics either teaches a few new things or provides thoughtful subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next level improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve gotten the hang of writing basic posts, I’ll probably put some effort into improving my writing style, focusing on fewer topics, and a few other areas of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, linking to these fun videos are a good motivator to keep writing! After catching up on some recent action with commercial space startups, it looks like the number of people building rocket engines continues to increase. In some ways it’s no surprise. While under 500 satellites were launched in 2017, the need for additional launch capacity continues to grow. Satellite constellations for global internet coverage are just one source of demand. Currently, OneWeb is considering a constellation of 2,000 satellites, while SpaceX is pondering a network of about 12,000 satellites. To get us there, Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket appears to be leading the vanguard of new rocket startups, given their successful orbital launch in January. Hats off to NZ for hosting not just Rocket Lab but also Kitty Hawk (whose video was featured in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/4-marvels-of-modern-transport/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

One area I’ve focused on (and will never feel “done” analyzing) is managing to do lists. There’s many ways of dealing with such a simple task, but below is my current method, which continues to evolve with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/03/Mindmap_example-768x542.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mindmap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big picture planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider big-picture thinking beyond the 5 year time horizon to be helpful in verifying that you’re setting directionally correct goals, but besides choosing a distant target, it’s very hard to make decisions today that you’ll agree with and follow through on after 5 years. Imagine yourself 5 years ago giving opinions and orders to yourself today. A prerequisite to setting big picture goals is knowing yourself, which is a topic unto it’s own, but I’d suggest a bucket list for those who haven’t created one yet. Let’s assume this is complete and you want to start moving in a certain direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Mindmap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found the mindmap structure (see image above) to be helpful when documenting the goals I have for the month ahead. Mindmaps are a versatile tool that can easily be adapted to capture nearly anything that comes to mind and quickly commit it to paper. I’ll group these tasks around key topics, such as “chores” or “career”, which can help filter away tasks that clearly don’t connect with useful or relevant goals. I find the difficult part is in capturing all tasks of importance. If I perform this step properly, my mind can avoid scenarios where I’m continually reminding myself to complete a certain task, which is a waste of mental energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the outline for the month is built, I try and take a number of tasks for each week as they arrive. Once the week’s items are chosen (requiring knowledge of the upcoming week’s schedule), I’m able to further break things down by day, turning the tasks into manageable morsels. I perform a weekly review, similar to Napoleon Hill’s concept of a Mastermind Group or Ben Franklin’s Junto, to keep myself on track and document observations. Among the questions I try to answer weekly are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are three small goals for the coming week?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are three large goals for the coming week?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did I learn last week?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What needs improvement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions not only help me understand trends over time and review past events, but they also provide thought into tasks that might pass by as missed learning opportunities otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of strategies for handling a to do list, and it’s highly dependent on personal preference, but this is my current strategy until further improvements arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One task that was on my to do list for a while was to become competent at drone racing, or RC flying in general. That goal has been relegated to the bucket list, but I’m still amazed at the abilities that automated systems have in this arena. The aggressive maneuvers shown below demonstrate the strength of a tightly-controlled feedback loop. However, I fear that it might take a significant amount of time and investment for such projects to make an appearance outside of labs, where the lack of calibrated sensors and unreliable nature of external stimuli can prove a hindrance. Yet perhaps in several years I can let an automated control system handle the drone racing for me while I watch the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/maslow-pt1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/maslow-pt2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/maslow-pt3/&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; for earlier details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a clarification: health is an extremely broad topic, and I’ll focus on nutrition here. In my mental model (which is very engineering-oriented), my body is akin to a car (or plane, or ship…), and I want my car to perform like a race car. Race cars have all types of specialized components, but they need high-octane fuel and lots of oxygen to do their job well. Similarly, I feel the need to constantly adapt my diet and exercise routine for performance optimization. I’m not claiming to be very good currently, but given my trend of improvement, a few insights below are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/03/Pyramid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alternative food pyramid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, many items on supermarket shelves aren’t very natural (fresh produce excluded). The items in cans or boxes usually weren’t simply picked off a tree, and even if so, they probably were processed in a factory of some sort. This is one reason I think it’s difficult for many to adapt towards a healthier diet: because it takes a conscious effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s misinformation and confusion around what constitutes a balanced diet. One needs only glance at the Food Pyramid &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_pyramid_(nutrition)#Controversy&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; to glimpse some of the controversy around inaccurate information. Based on some concepts in the book “Fantastic Voyage”, by Kurzweil and Grossman, I’d prefer a pyramid more similar to the one above. Note how dramatically different the pyramid may look when compared to the relative quantity of offerings in a typical supermarket. This shows the effort and self-discipline required to stray away from eating “whatever looks good”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizing consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person only needs a set number of calories to get through a day. The three sources of calories are fats, proteins, and carbohydrates (vitamins, fiber, etc. don’t supply calories). Though it might be surprising, carbohydrates aren’t necessary for the body, or at least not to the level of fats and proteins (think of an Inuit diet). Every day, you get to choose where these calories come from. If cookies or similar snacks are offered by friends or coworkers, it’s your choice to indulge. If you choose to avoid such options, the same conscious effort and self-discipline mention above will apply. Even choosing what beverage, and what quantity, you intake each day is a crucial decision. As with other opportunities, don’t forget to vote!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important ability is to question advice and not accept it at face value. If it works for someone else, that’s great, but don’t conclude that it will provide you the same results. After compiling a collection of ideas, it’s crucial to experiment and find what suits you best. Beyond the reaction your body might have to food, it’s important to find what other variables you value. Some foodies might prefer the taste or presentation of the food. Currently, I prefer minimal cooking time, and build my repertoire around this feature. At the end of the day, your body is providing you with a better instantaneous feedback loop than medical instruments can, so it’s helpful to try and harness that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t pass up the earlier reference to a race car without featuring the most overpower car in existence. With thousands of extra horsepower than the Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship, but speeding just one passenger along, the Bloodhound SSC is a rocket-powered monstrosity of a four-wheeled vehicle. Last year it reached a reasonable 200 mph during its public testing debut. The goal is 1000 mph, and I wish the team the best.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s examine the current state of brick and mortar education vs. online education as measured by a variety of metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not much contest when cost is the factor. Many MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are free to take, although costs can increase depending on the course. Certificate programs from well known universities usually cost more, but the university is associating their prestige with the material. However, this pales in comparison to the average cost of a 4 year private college in the USA, which costs around $30k+/yr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winner:&lt;/u&gt; Online education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropout rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the USA, college graduation rates aren’t great. Many metrics show that the USA’s educational system doesn’t stack up too well when compared to other developed countries. In the USA, about 40-60% of college attendees actually receive a degree within their first 6 years of college. However, this is dramatically better than the 7-10% completion rate of MOOC courses. It should be noted that this comparison is not truly equal, since MOOC courses can include students from anywhere (not just the USA), and the  completion rate is for individual courses, not a full degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winner:&lt;/u&gt; Brick and mortar education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is a trove of data, so it’s hard to argue that the internet in aggregate would be less informative than brick and mortar an undergraduate class. However, classes are designed specifically to convey the most crucial aspects of a topic that a student would find useful. I would argue that classes based largely on reading the material, lectures, and homework exercises can be taught equally efficiently in the offline and online medium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Winner:&lt;/span&gt; Tie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respectability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of a degree is in the eye of the beholder, so it’s highly subjective. My personal opinion is that brick and mortar education wins easily today, but there’s some specific skills (e.g. programming) where online education is already starting to compete in some niche expertise areas. I think that once the number of niche subjects with high quality online programs proliferate, that online education will become more competitive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Winner:&lt;/span&gt; Brick and mortar education (for now…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll start by framing this by stating that I am examining this category with respect to time spent in class and ignoring time spent outside of class (because arguably an online education only offers “time spent in class”). Interacting with a cohort of fellow motivated students is arguably one of the more valuable takeaways from a brick and mortar education. But I argue that this is NOT the purpose of tuition for at a typical school. It’s a nice feature at brick and mortar schools, but the school provides a meager portion of tuition funds for student activities. Post-graduation, the same activities found in student activities can be found as community groups, which charge an annual fee significantly lower than tuition fees (if there’s a charge at all). So while I would agree that an online education as it stands today does not encourage the building of soft skills, an online education couple with soft skill activities outside of time spent in class should not be any less conducive than a brick and mortar education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Winner:&lt;/u&gt; Tie (but debatable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I see a point in the future, perhaps 15-20 years from today, where online classes and degrees are at least as useful for learning as offline classes. Even if online degrees are not as well respected by that point, I see an inflection point on the horizon where partaking in an online education becomes a more serious alternative to an expensive brick and mortar college education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Tammet’s amazing memory and learning ability is unusually adept, in part because he is a savant. His memory feats include memorizing pi to over 22,000 digits and learning Icelandic in a week, as the video below shows. There’s ongoing research into whether the exceptional abilities that some savants possess could be harnessed by the greater populous, and I’m intrigued to see what conclusions this research comes to in the future. However, despite Daniel’s memory abilities, he only placed 4th in the 2000 world memory championships, which goes to show how training the mind can also bring about exceptional results.&lt;/p&gt;

I classify non-positives as &lt;em&gt;methods of spending time that do not directly contribute to larger goals that you are currently working towards&lt;/em&gt;. These can be distracting activities (I’m talking to you, youtube), nagging thoughts on your mind, or anything else that may take resources, and especially time, from better uses. As I have to remind myself on occasion, time is my one non-renewable asset, and it should be considered seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/2018/03/operations-300x89.png&quot; alt=&quot;Subtracting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These non-positives can vary from one person to another and depend on the circumstances. If I’ve blocked out time to wind down for bed, perhaps the activities I consider non-positives are different than my considerations around lunchtime. I’ve found some items are consistent non-positives for me, such as certain foods/drinks, some forms of entertainment (e.g. tv shows), and regular chores (e.g. shopping). Some of these I’ve removed, others are at other stages of removable (based on the cost-benefit of the solution), and others I still have to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to take this to the extreme, we might consider eating, or even sleeping, to be non-positive. After all, they only indirectly contribute to a larger goal we’re focused on. For these so-called essentials, I find it helpful to try and trim the overhead around the essential activity to save time. For instance, falling asleep 15 minutes faster will effectively save 15 minutes per day (try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erikelbieh.com/blog/maslow-pt2/&quot;&gt;these tips&lt;/a&gt;). Cooking a meal that meets your standards in half the amount of time will also make an impact (think of a microwave). Similarly, if it’s possible to eat a meal faster or more efficiently in a way that your body accepts without complaint (think of a smoothie), that could also be useful optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I care about seemingly trivial tasks? I think of it as investing my time wisely, and the investment compounds over time. If you start removing non-positives sooner, you’ll save more time in the long run, and potentially some of the additional time to think about removing other non-positives. Plus, it’s a good habit to build. In short, I don’t see much of a downside while there’s potential for significant upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a footnote, I’ll add that one activity I’ll be partaking in shortly is tracking how I use my time throughout the day. I’ve read many accounts that a person’s initial estimates of where time is used and the actual data rarely correlate well. Allocating time properly is a skill that everyone can improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a snowboarder, removing the obstacles between you and the mountain brings you closer to your sport (and your goals, if that’s what you want to do). Mike Basich decided to live directly on the mountain and forego a few conveniences of a traditional 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century American home. While this exact solution is targeted towards snowboarding, this video shows one man’s take on how to go about removing non-positives, and in doing so, creating a unique environment to focus on the things you find important. Plus, it’s a pretty nice tiny house!&lt;/p&gt;

The new experiences, sights, and cultural idiosyncrasies offer a unique learning environment. And if you already utilize these tips, perhaps the video at the end will give some new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meet new people&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This can mean different things depending on how you’re traveling. If you’re traveling solo and staying in hostels, start a conversation with other travelers. If you’re in a hotel with your family, perhaps try talking with local employees. All I can add is that the people you meet truly shape your experience during your trip. Some of my most memorable adventures have happened purely because I met some interesting people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare prices&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An obvious one, but this applies to flights, buses, trains, hotels, hostels, and more. For example, Hostel World might be a convenient website to locate hostels, but booking directly through the hostel’s own website (or another booking platform, like booking.com) can offer a better rate. Additionally, when searching for flights, I find it helpful to check flight deal sites such as alltheflightdeals.com to see if I can get to a neighboring city for a better price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Travel-specific gear&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Personally, the best space-saving tip I’ve learned is to use a travel towel and a collapsible water bottle. You won’t regret getting backpacking-specific gear, as long as you use it frequently. This requirement is key – make sure you’ve tested your gear before the trip. The last thing you want to do is buy a titanium spork only to find you don’t like eating with a spork.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take only pictures, leave only footprints&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I try to avoid shopping while traveling, but this is partially personal preference. Perhaps a small unique souvenir is found, or maybe a gift for friends or family is called for. In general though, I find it’s best to minimize souvenir purchases and just capture the essence of a trip with photography.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take time away from museums and similar attractions&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How often do you visit the museums in the town you live? So why are you visiting so many now that you’re traveling? For a more local vibe during your trip, see what life is like when you try to follow your typical daily schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find nature&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hopping between cities can be exciting, but I’ve found that I enjoy trips with some balance between nature and city environments. Of course, if the trip is intended purely to explore the great outdoors, even better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t rely on currency exchange companies&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Entering a foreign country without local currency can conjure many sorts of worrisome scenarios. But If you’ve got a debit card, using an ATM at the airport upon arrival may be a more efficient and economical solution. Of course, check foreign transaction fees on those cards first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s video is a bit trite, but I hope it will inspire a reader to set out upon an adventure, which I assume is video’s goal. Alastair Humphreys was named a National Geographic Adventurer of the Year in 2012 after biking around the world, running across the Sahara, and rowing across the Atlantic. One intriguing idea he’s brought forth to those of us who are slightly less adventurous is the idea of a microadventure. As everyday life become more timeboxed and many formerly-relaxed activities are seemingly sped up, seeking adventures in a location more convenient makes a lot of sense. It makes you ponder whether travel and adventure is just a perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people ponder mathematics or philosophy, but my daily thoughts are more more mundane. I am often in a situation when I use a paper towel to dry my hands after washing them (in public, definitely not at home) and ponder what impact I’m having on the world with my decision. I will now answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the assumption that a paper towel weighs about 2 grams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2014-4-july-august/green-life/how-much-paper-does-one-tree-produce&quot;&gt;rule of thumb&lt;/a&gt; from the Sierra Club, we will estimate that 8 trees produce 1000 pounds of paper. In other words, 1 tree will produce 125 pounds of paper, which is equivalent to 56,699 grams of paper. We can then see that 28,350 paper towels can be produced from that one large tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how many towels do you use in a year? Lets estimate you wash hands 3 times per day, and each time you use one paper towel. If you work 5 days a week for 48 weeks (this assumes 4 total weeks of vacation time or working from other locations with towels/hand dryers), this is 240 work days. So using 3 paper towels a day for a year required 720 paper towels. At the end of the day, about 39 people would use enough paper towel in one year to kill a tree (or one person for 39 years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we estimate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;impact for such an act such as cutting down a tree? Using pine trees as an example, at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfrc.ufl.edu/Extension/FFSnl/ffsnl34e.htm&quot;&gt;one source states&lt;/a&gt; that pines can be cut after growing for 20 years. Let’s assume that these tree would live to be 200 years old if they had not been cut down, meaning that 180 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption would be lost in the act of cutting down the tree. As a rough rule of thumb if we assume that a tree absorbs 50 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in one year, then we cutting the tree down will effectively leave 9,000 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere that could otherwise have been absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we can equate the cutting down of a tree to producing 28,350 paper towels, which creates 9,000 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This equates to 0.32 pounds (144 grams) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for each paper towel used, or about 230 pounds (104 kg) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year based on the consumption of 720 paper towels per year. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle&quot;&gt;EPA estimates&lt;/a&gt; that driving one mile in a car produces about 411 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so a daily consumption of 3 paper towels per day equates to driving an extra mile in a car each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, many assumptions were made above, and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://msl.mit.edu/Publications/HandDryingLCA-ExecutiveSummary.PDF&quot;&gt;MIT research paper&lt;/a&gt; calculated a much lower number for paper towel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact. Additionally, the MIT paper concluded that modern hand dryers, such as the airblade from Dyson, produces 1/3rd of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a paper towel. However accurate this rough analysis is, I for one will now feel more informed about my daily choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Extreme Exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the environmental and global theme, this timelapse is an amazing compilation of images taken from the International Space Station (ISS). What’s striking is how ingrained a world map is in my mind, where the country boundaries clearly separate regions of different colors on a 2-D surface. However, what I notice from the perspective of the ISS are the light sources, the water/land ratio, and the distinct lack of any boundaries. Yet another perspective to ponder, especially since this one isn’t subject to projection distortion and other cartographic inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;
