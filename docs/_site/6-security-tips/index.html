<p>Before continuing, I’d like to add that the security chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link, and that link is often the human in the loop. Sorry to insinuate, but you’ve probably reused a password on more than one site in your past, or clicked on a link in an email that might not have been authenticate, or visited sites that you realized may have had nefarious purposes. If you find patches for these human flaws, do let me know, but the tips below can start upgrading your daily security utilization starting now.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Update your web browser to the latest version</span></p>

<p>Yep, as easy as it sounds. As an added bonus, programs most often used for opening files downloaded from the internet (e.g. PDF reader, word processor, image viewer, etc.) should also be updated.</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Oh, and while you’re at it, just update your operating system, and all other programs you’ve installed.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Get antivirus</span></p>

<p>Antivirus is your friend! Especially for Windows, Mac, Android, etc. And there are multiple free <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-us/index">options</a>. Any questions?</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Use an operating system no one has ever heard of. Or never use the internet. Ever.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Modify your browser’s built-in settings</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you changed your Facebook privacy settings recently, but Read through settings and activate as much security as you please (cookies, plugins, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Firefox users can play around with about:config for more advanced settings, and while chrome users should just switch to Firefox, there’s some additional settings in chrome://flags.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Use strong and unique passwords</span></p>

<p>If you don’t use a password manager yet, I highly recommend it. Using a strong password is a crucial first step towards securing your personal data. Even better, use 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) on important websites, like your financial accounts. Remember not to use the same password on multiple sites – I warned you! You can use <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">this site</a> to run a (non-comprehensive) check if you were affected by a recent hack.</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Use an offline password manager, because that’s what <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/">Bruce Schneier does</a> when designing a password manager. Always max out the allowable password length on websites. Activate 2FA whenever possible. Encrypt everything!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Use HTTPS</span></p>

<p>Activate HTTPS whenever possible. It’s easiest to do with an add-on, such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>. While you’re at it, you can investigate other add-ons, like ad blockers.</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Install a boatload of addons! One to <a href="https://noscript.net/">block javascript</a>, one to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/">autodelete cookies</a>, one to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/">block WebRTC</a>, etc.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Use WPA2 WiFi encryption</span></p>

<p>Friends don’t let friends use anything less than WPA2 security on their WiFi. And remember to use a strong password both for the WiFi hotspot as well as the router login page (usually located at 192.168.0.1 by default). Go ahead, check right now and see if they WiFi you are using is WPA2 or not. If not, run!</p>

<p><strong>Paranoid?</strong> Setup your home network such that only devices you add to your router’s whitelist are allowed on the network. Upgrade to a router that takes security seriously. Always use a VPN or Tor. Maybe add an IDS system to your home network, and a honeypot, just to feel a bit safer.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Extreme Exception</strong></p>

<p>If you’re running away from insecure technologies, there’s few better ways to do that than by running over 100 miles. If I had to pick a group of athletes that I’d consider among the most extreme athletes (in terms of mental and physical performance, not risk), ultramarathoners would be among my top picks. I find it intriguing that diet was not much of a concern for ultrarunners 30-40 years ago (the thought being that all calories are good, because they’ll be burnt), but there’s an increasing population of vegans now. Perhaps this is due to increased interest in eating a vegan diet in recent years, but perhaps it’s indicative of some correlation between diet and performance. Scott Jurek is a vegan and one of the most well-known ultramarathoners, having won the Western States 100 mile race seven consecutive times. Admittedly watching someone run isn’t the most exciting action caught on video, but Scott ran the Appalachian Trail in under 47 days (averaging nearly 50 miles/day over rough terrain) to set a new trail record.</p>
