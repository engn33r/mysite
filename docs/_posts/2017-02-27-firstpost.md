#### What’s this blog about? Is it another self improvement blog? This guy is going to ramble about life in the abstract? Or is he just another travel buff?

Over the past year I’ve tried to figure out this whole post-college life using an engineering mindset of optimizing everything. I’ve come across many ideas, some which I have found quite helpful, and the blog is a means to capturing those ideas. I want to create a place where I can lay out details of actions I have taken, and a venue to explore ideas that I’m considering or recently learned of.

As the title suggests, I sometimes set my own expectations at such a high level that even arriving at the halfway point might be considered &#8220;good enough&#8221;. I believe that too many graduates numbly proceed through the next several years of life without much of a gameplan and without consideration of all possible options. I agree that almost everything worth doing is difficult, but there’s endless possibilities if expectations are set accordingly.<!--more-->

I hope this blog might inspire some readers to modify their daily life and maximize their experience along the way. By considering risky ideas and questioning obvious choices, many surprising routes and ideas can be found. The key is knowing that these possibilities exist and that they are worth seeking out.

This motivation for the blog is selfish in part. I see it as a method of documenting my thoughts for later reference, an opportunity to connect with like-minded people, a technique to stay accountable to goals, and an outlet for some of my creative energy. The ideas I plan to share aren’t unique inventions of my own making, but moreso a compilation of learnings from media that I’ve put my own spin on. I hope to provide a unique younger (naive?) perspective, specifically geared for recent college graduates.

I’m setting a goal of at least one post per week throughout the remainder of 2017. I’ll cover the groundwork of how I got started optimizing various aspects of my life and discuss areas where I&#8217;m working to ramp things up another notch. I enjoy receiving reader input, so please reach out through the [contact](http://erikelbieh.com/contact.html) page.

## Weekly Extreme Exception

I like a motivational quote as much as the next person, but I find cool videos much more entertaining, eye-opening, and memorable. I also appreciate the fact that a video demonstrates something actually achieved rather than an abstract notion.

This week’s subject is the Curiosity Mars Rover and the team behind it. I eagerly consumed all facts about this rover during the weeks before and after landing. I still enjoy geeking out about it when planetary exploration comes up in conversation. The landing system employed was truly unique and creative!
