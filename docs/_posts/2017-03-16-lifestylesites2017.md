Over the years, my collection of most-visited websites slowly shifts as my interests change over time. These are a few of my current favorites related to lifestyle choices. I think the main reason they’re interesting is because they offer unique edge-case perspectives that provide insight into exploring similar options.

**Unique Personal** **Perspectives**

[Tynan](http://www.tynan.com/) – I would describe Tynan as someone who carved his own path in nearly every way. I recommend you read his [About page](http://tynan.com/about) for a synopsis, because there’s no quick way to explain his life trajectory. He’s written many thoughtful and relevant blog posts.

[Chris Guillebeau](https://chrisguillebeau.com/) – Chris authored a book titled “The Art of Non-Conformity” and has visited all 193 countries in the world. He’s an expert travel hacker and, like Tynan, has been constantly on the move for large periods of time. That sounds pretty nifty to me, and I’ve been poking around his site since learning about it.

**Travel**

[Frequent Miler](http://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/) – Many sites discuss travel hacking, but I like the organization of Frequent Miler. It helps that I’ve met Greg and can vouch that he’s even more knowledgeable than the site leads you to believe. For those just learning what this is, there’s a free course at [travelmiles101.com](http://www.travelmiles101.com/) that can get you up to speed.

[Snarky Nomad](http://snarkynomad.com/) – After finding Tynan’s site, and specifically his (ultralight packing) [gear post](http://tynan.com/gear2017), I became intrigued by the rise of travel gear that doesn’t compromise on design. Fortunately, Eytan provides expert advice in this area and my travel wardrobe is receiving several upgrades thanks to his insights.

**Finance**

[Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) – Many personal finance websites exist, but Pete writes one of the most well-known and most entertaining. As the site&#8217;s popularity would have you guess, there’s plenty of amazing useful posts to read in the “classics” section.

[Mad Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/) – I’m an engineer and like to optimize everything. It was refreshing for me to find a personal finance website written by someone with a similar mindset. Brandon has drilled down in depth into many details I wouldn’t have the patience for, saving me much time and effort.

**Podcasts**

[Ownstream](http://ownstream.co/ownstreampodcast/) – This site is the newest on my radar, but Theresa and Stephen incorporate many ideas I’ve found among the other sites here. Right now I’m enjoying their podcast, as I’ve found each one quite interesting so far.

[Tim Ferriss](http://tim.blog/podcast/) – I happened upon Tim’s podcast when searching for an interview of a particular person, and found that he has interviewed quite a number of top-performers with fascinating insights. I enjoy the variety of perspectives from many people found in this single podcast. Tim also has written several books that I can highly recommend.

**Weekly Extreme Exception**

While I’m on the topic of my current favorite resources online, I’ll add that Red Bull’s youtube channel has offered me hours or entertainment. They’ve worked with so many extreme athletes that they appear to be running out of stunts that haven’t been done yet. The following video features several types of flying all synchronized in one artistic choreographed display. None of these forms of flight would have been conceivable a couple centuries ago, but nowadays this is how these athletes spend their spare time.

[![Red Bull 8 disciplines of flight](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wmBvgs-qqPY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmBvgs-qqPY "8 Disciplines of Flight Converge over Moab - Chain Reaction (4k)")
