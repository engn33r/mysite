Sometime last year, I realized that there’s many big questions that have passed through my mind that I couldn’t say I had a good answer to. For instance, I used to be asked (in my younger days) “What do you want to be when you grow up?”, but a more relevant question for me now is “what job/role are you going to have in 10 years?”.

I believe that answering these long-term questions are important to setting a trajectory and serving as a reminder to stay on track. I recently compiled a list of questions that I thought could better orient my daily choices. Many of these come from various interviews I’ve heard, so I decided to “interview myself” and dedicate some time to think about some serious answers to these questions. See if you’ve got your answers ready for the following:

  1. If you could go back in time and give one piece of advice to your 20-year old self, what would it be?
  2. Who is the first person that comes to mind when you hear the word “success”?
  3. What are your lifetime goals?
  4. How would you like to spend the next 5 years?
  5. What’s your greatest fear?
  6. If you had all the world’s resources but could only solve one problem, what problem would you solve?
  7. If you could be remembered for only one thing, what would it be?
  8. What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
  9. Imagine you suddenly received everything you wanted. Describe what your perfect day would look like in as much detail as possible, from waking up to bedtime.
 10. What goal are you working on achieving right now?

**Weekly Extreme Exception**

I must have been less than 10 years old when I caught the flying bug. A local air show got me hooked as the aerobatic planes performed maneuvers than seemed physically impossible in the air. I am happy to say I now have the means to pursue the dream of a pilot’s license, and although it’s not quite as easy as turning the key and taking off, it’s a lot of fun. It was only by making a conscious choice to set priorities that has allowed me to do that.

However, the two guys in the video have been flying together for longer than I’ve been wishing I could fly. If you’re familiar with the Red Bull Air Race, another event that I’m a fan of, one of these pilots (Steve) is a judge and the other (Paul) is a three time winner of the event. Although the video is cut to make the stunt appear “dramatic”, I doubt these two would have gone through with it if there were any serious concerns.
